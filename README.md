# Zone Prototype

Loads the list of zones, splits them into overlapping and non-overlapping sections, merges where needed while respecting zone priority, and creates a tree structure to bring searches to O(log(n)) in a best case scenario.

To try the prototype, change your working directory to the python folder, and run any of the test scripts found there. All of the logic behind this is in the lib folder inside.

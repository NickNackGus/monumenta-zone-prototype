# Zone Prototype

Loads the list of zones, splits them into overlapping and non-overlapping sections, merges where needed while respecting zone priority, and eventually will create a tree structure to bring searches to O(log(n)) in a best case scenario.

WIP, please excuse the lack of documentation.
